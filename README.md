unMAP.me or Compass (since i do not need MAP)
=========

A tool to hack Minimum Advertised Priced policies
Compass, shopping without a map.


Stuff
=====

User - Basic sign in functionality

Product - The item to be haggled

Price Point - What a user is willing to pay for a product


Pitch
=====

I believe in stuff on the internet being cheaper than on physical stores. That's why I hate Minimum Advertised Price policies.

MAP means more money to manufacturers, less to consumers.

Introducing unMAP.me, just to mess up with manufacturers.
