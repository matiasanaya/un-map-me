unMAP.me
========

Also known as Compass (since i do not need MAP), is a tool to socialy hack Minimum Advertised Priced policies. This project was built during the SF 2013 AngelHacks Hackathon.


Structure
---------

User - Basic sign in functionality

Product - The item to be haggled

Price Point - What a user is willing to pay for a product


Pitch
-----

I believe in stuff on the internet being cheaper than on physical stores. That's why I hate Minimum Advertised Price policies.

MAP means more money to manufacturers, less to consumers.

Introducing unMAP.me, just to mess up with manufacturers.
