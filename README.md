========

Also known as Compass (since i do not need MAP), is a tool to socialy hack Minimum Advertised Priced policies. This project was built during the SF 2013 AngelHacks Hackathon.


Motivation
----------

I believe in stuff being cheaper on the internet than on physical stores. That's why I do not care for Minimum Advertised Price policies. MAP means more profits for manufacturers, less benefits for consumers.

Structure
---------

User - Basic sign in functionality

Product - The item to be haggled

Price Point - What a user is willing to pay for a product
